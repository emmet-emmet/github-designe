      <h3>I received a job offer mid-course,and the subjects I learned were current,if not more so,in the company I joined.
        I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h3>

      <h5 class="cliff">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a trasition and have heard some people
        who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
        thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the bast-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully
        switched carreers, working as software engineer at a VR startup."</h5>

      <h3 class="kir">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
      <h5 class="ki">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
        professional who can help me learning programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
        of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum an staff did not disappoint.
        They were very hands-on and I never had to weit long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
        It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often
        referred to it doring interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly halped me land a job as a full-stack developer
        after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "</h5>
